# Frogfind Browser for Windows Phone Beta
Frogfind Browser for Windows Phone 8.1 and Soon other Windows Phone Versions
# ⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN BETA, DON'T EXPECT IT TO HAVE MASSIVE CHANGES EVERY RELEASE. MAKING RELEASES FOR THIS IS A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS
It's a very simple browser, don't expect the best quality from it, but i'm working on making it more usable and better. 


## Special Credits to Sean (Aka Action Retro on YouTube) and the other people behind FrogFind, whose website made this possible.
