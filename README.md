# 🐸 Frogfind Browser for Windows Phone Beta
## ⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ALPHA, AND HAS LOTS OF BUGS. ANY ISSUES YOU DETECT, PLEASE TELL ME IN THE ISSUES TAB. 
FrogFind as a Simple Web App for Windows Phone 8.1 and soon 10 and possibly 7 & 8 if I can get them working. 
It's a very simple browser, don't expect the best quality from it, but i'm working on making it better. 

### Special Credits to Sean (Aka Action Retro on YouTube) and the other people behind FrogFind, whose website made this possible. 

# Compilation Instructions
If you don't want to download the prebuilt binaries or want the latest nightly release, use these. 
First, you're going to want to download Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012 (not Express) and install it. Make sure to activate it with a product key while offline for maximum compatability. 
Then, download the Windows Phone 8.1 SDK (Preferrably from this repo: https://archive.org/details/wpsdk8 )
Then just open the sln file and get to compiling! It should work out of the box. 
- Keep in mind the emulators dont seem to work anymore on Windows 8.1 Up (I believe)
