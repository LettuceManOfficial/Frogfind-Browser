# 🐸 Frogfind Browser for Windows Phone Beta
## ⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ALPHA, AND HAS LOTS OF BUGS. ANY ISSUES YOU DETECT, PLEASE TELL ME IN THE ISSUES TAB. 
FrogFind as a Simple Web App for Windows Phone 8.1 and soon 10 and possibly 7 & 8 if I can get them working. 
It's a very simple browser, don't expect the best quality from it, but i'm working on making it better. 

### Special Credits to Sean (Aka Action Retro on YouTube) and the other people behind FrogFind, whose website made this possible.
